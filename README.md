The aim of this project is to build a classifier that can distinguish between real and fake news articles using the fake and real news dataset from Kaggle. This is a NLP problem, so various methods of feature extraction can be applied and this is demonstrated in the project, for example word count, TFIDF features and also using deep learning method.

### Technologies

- Typical data science tools - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
- Deep learning frameworks - `PyTorch`, `PyTorch Lightning`.
- Model interpretation tools - `SHAP`.
